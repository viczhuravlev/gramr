    splitOnChars (Array). Determines what characters to use to chunk an element into smaller pieces. Version 0.1 of Clamp.js would always remove each individual character to check for fit. With v0.2, you now have an option to pass a list of characters it can use. For example, it you pass an array of ... then it will first remove sentences, then remove comma-phrases, and remove words, and finally remove individual characters to try and find the correct height. This will lead to increased performance and less looping when removing larger pieces of text (such as in paragraphs). The default is set to remove sentences (periods), hypens, en-dashes, em-dashes, and finally words (spaces). Removing by character is always enabled as the last attempt no matter what is submitted in the array.
